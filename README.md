# Labo 7 Make a static site generator

You will need to read a lot. After that it is just debugging and
struggling to find/understand the documentation surrounding what you are doing. 
Spent a total of 6 hours on this most of my time went into reading "basic" concepts like:
- what is a SSG
- what is MARKDOWN
- what is FRONT MATTER
- what is YAML
- what is JINJA
- how do I get from Markdown to actual html
- how do I get the frontmatter out of the markdown text
- how do I create a template and navigation bar
- how do I change variable (how does JINJA and its templating work.

It was a ok project. Spent way too much time reading while I already had the puzzle pieces for making it happen.
Jinja's documentation also isn't that well structured AND there are no examples which 
I need to trult understand what is happening (And I prefer not asking CHATGPT for examples). 
Which didn't happen there was a very nice website how throught the motions [Link to step-by-step guide](https://realpython.com/primer-on-jinja-templating/)
They only show the html template without ever showing the python script causing the changes.
